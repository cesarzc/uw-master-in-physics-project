\chapter {Superconducting Hardware Platform}

\todo{Briefly this quantum computing platform.}

\section{Native Gates and Platform Characteristics}

\todo{Enumerate the native gates that this platform implements, its characteristics (fidelity, gate time), and how logical gates are implemented (using circuits to illustrate them).}

\section{Resources Estimation Analysis}

\todo{Show (using tables and/or plots) how resources escalate as the size and pattern of the secret string change}.

\section{Analysis of Execution Feasibility in NISQ Devices}

\todo{Analyze what would be the maximum size (and difficulty of pattern) of the secret string that can be used in a current NISQ device based on this platform.}
