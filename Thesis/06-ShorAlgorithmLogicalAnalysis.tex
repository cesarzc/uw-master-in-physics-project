\chapter {Shor's Algorithm Logical Analysis}

\todo{Explain the following}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resources Metrics: Describe the values obtained from the resources estimator (gate count, runtime, accumulated error), and how they are calculated.
    \item Gate Decomposition: Describe why logical-level gates have to be decomposed into physical-level gates.
    \item Limitations: Describe the limitations that this resources estimation has in regards to runtime (sum of the runtimes of individual gates rather than the critical path), and types of computations (trouble with mixed states).
\end{itemize}
