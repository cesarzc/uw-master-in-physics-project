\abstract{%
An important task in the development of quantum computing technologies is to determine the resources needed to execute a particular algorithm in a device with certain characteristics. Resources estimation allows not only to determine whether it is possible to execute an algorithm in a current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device, but also to experiment with the parameters of quantum hardware to find out how much it would have to scale to achieve quantum advantage. For this thesis, we use the Q\# quantum programming language to implement Shor's semiprime integer factorization algorithm, leverage the infrastructure built around Q\# to estimate the resources required to run the algorithm on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum hardware platforms, and do a comparison between the two physical platforms based on the results.
