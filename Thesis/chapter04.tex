\chapter {Quantum Algorithm (Semiprime Integer Factorization)}

Shor's algorithm is a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for semiprime integer factorization. In comparison, the time complexity of the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm is superpolynomial.

\section{Algorithm}

The problem that Shor's algorithm solves is the following: given a semiprime integer \textit{N}, find its two prime factor \textit{p} and \textit{q}.

\todo{Describe the algorithm.}

\section{Quantum Subroutine}

\todo{Show the circuit representation of the quantum subroutine.}

\section{Q\# Implementation}

The following Q\# code presents a top-level implementation of Shor's algorithm. It is a slight modification to the implementation found in Microsoft's quantum samples GitHub repository.

\todo{Add reference to Microsoft's quantum samples repository.}

\todo{Consider creating a Q\# language option for lstlisting.}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
@EntryPoint()
operation FactorSemiprimeInteger (N: Int) : (Int, Int) {
    // TODO: Paste implementation.
}
\end{lstlisting}

The following Q\# code presents a top-level implementation of the period-finding subroutine.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
    @EntryPoint()
    operation EstimatePeriod(N : Int, a : Int) : Int {
        // TODO: Paste implementation.
        return 0;
    }
\end{lstlisting}
