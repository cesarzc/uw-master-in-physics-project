\chapter {Extending Q\# Simulation Infrastructure for Estimation of Physical Resources}

Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit (QDK) supports the implementation of custom simulators that can be used to run Q\# programs. We leverage this capability and implement a simulator that calculates the resources a quantum algorithm would require to be executed in a hardware platform with specific characteristics.
