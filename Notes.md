# Notes

This document is meant for taking raw notes about the project.

## Project
- [ ] Consider using an algorithm with more circuit depth (e.g. Shor, Grover, Simon's) to allow error correction to play a more important role.
    - Best kind of algorithm is one that uses few qubits and performs a lot of gate operations on them.
- [ ] The open-system simulator + resource estimation analysis could be done for just one platform in case the comparison is too much.

## Document Work Items
- [ ] Change the title to "Analysis of Quantum Computing Algorithm Execution in Multiple Physical Platforms"
    - [ ] Change the text that has been already written considering this new title.
